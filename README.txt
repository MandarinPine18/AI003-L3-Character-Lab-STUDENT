DIRECTIONS:

Your end product is a program which allows a user to create whatever character they want. Read over the code I gave you first, then look at this list of things you need to do. You need to:
1. ask for user's name
2. greet user with their name
3. ask them which character class they want to make
    - elf - they shoot arrows at enemies, dealing 20 damage to the enemy (you need to write code for this)
    - wizard - they cast spells at enemies, dealing 30 damage to the enemy and losing 10 energy in the process (you need to write code for this)
    - warrior - they charge at enemies, dealing 45 damage to the enemy and 20 damage to themselves (you need to write code for this)
4. ask for the character's name and create a character based on the previous response
    - you need to define and use the constructor for credit
5. ask for the attribute characteristics (strength, intelligence, stealth)
6. print out the character along with the characteristics
    - you need to define and use get_info() for credit
7. use a method to check whether health is below 50, 50 or above, or 100 and return a statement about it
    - you need to define and use get_health_string() for credit

EXTRA CREDIT:
- allow a user a sort of command-line-like way to change attributes and do stuff
- save characters for users and allow users to load characters they previously made
- create a second character and use it as an enemy to fight
- make something beyond the scope of what even I can do that I haven't thought of (e.g. graphics, music, campaign)
